Overview
--------

Purpose
~~~~~~~

A Project Brief is used to provide a full and firm foundation for the
initiation of the project and is created in the Starting up a Project process.

In the Initiating a Project process, the contents of the Project Brief are
extended and refined in the Project Initiation Documentation, after which the
Project Brief is no longer maintained.

.. <C-E> cc



Advice
~~~~~~

The Project Brief is derived from: A project mandate supplied at the start of
the project; Programme management - if the project is part of a programme, the
Project Brief is likely to be supplied by the programme, and therefore it will
not have to be derived from a project mandate; Discussions with corporate
management regarding corporate strategy and any policies and standards that
apply; Discussions with the Project Board and users if the project mandate is
incomplete or if no project mandate is provided; Discussions with the
operations and maintenance organization (if applicable); Discussion with the
(potential) suppliers regarding specialist development lifecycles that could be
used; Lessons Log.

A Project Brief can take a number of formats, including: Document or
presentation slides; Entry in a project management tool.

The following quality criteria should be observed:

- It is brief because its purpose at this point is to provide a firm basis on
  which to initiate a project. It will later be refined and expanded as part of
  the Project Initiation Documentation

- The Project Brief accurately reflects the project mandate and the
  requirements of the business and the users

- The project approach considers a range of solutions, such as: bespoke or
  off-the-shelf; contracted out or developed in-house; designed from new or a
  modified existing product

- The project approach has been selected which maximizes the chance of
  achieving overall success for the project

- The project objectives, project approach and strategies are consistent with
  the organization's corporate social responsibility directive

- The project objectives are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and
  Time-bound (SMART).
